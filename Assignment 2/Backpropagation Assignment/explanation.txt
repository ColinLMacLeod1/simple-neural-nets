Instructions:
Run python main.py
Be sure that the data file and Network.py file are in the
same folder that the program is executed in

- Initial weights: The initial weights were random and normalized because the output was normalized.

- Node output function: The sigmoid function was chosen as it is continuously differentiable as is
required for Backpropagation

- Learning rate: The learning rate was selected at 0.1 to be small enough to allow
and accurate solution, however it can be altered if the number of iterations is changed

- Termination Criteria: iterations
The max number of iterations can be altered to maximize training based on
time and processing power available.

- Data pre processing
The data was normalized and sorted into inputs and output arrays

- The data was split 75% training and 25% and was divided such that every fourth
data point was added to test and the rest to train so that training and test would both
contain all output types.
